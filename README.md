# 🧭 MazePathProject

This project demonstrates two classical algorithmic problems — **Rat in a Maze** and **Path Counting with Exact Coin Sum** — using **backtracking** and **recursive techniques** in **C++**.

## 🧠 Problem Statements

### 🐭 1. Rat in a Maze (Backtracking Approach)

- The maze is represented by a 2D grid where:
  - `1` indicates a valid path.
  - `0` indicates a wall.
- The rat starts at a given position and must find a path to a specified end position.
- The rat can move in **two directions
